# memorygame

This is a memory game made as part of the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree. 

Instructions:
1. Click any of the cards. This starts the timer.
2. Click another card. This adds one to the moves text. If the cards don't match, they flip over and go back to being unseen. If the cards match, they remain open with the image of the card facing up. 
3. Keep on clicking cards and matching them until all the cards are matched. 
4. At the end of the game, a popup is brought up saying Congratulations with the time, number of moves, and star rating.
